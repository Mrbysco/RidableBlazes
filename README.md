# Ridable Blazes #

## About ##
The **Ridable Blazes** mod allows players to equip a saddle onto a blaze and start riding the blaze. You have to be careful though since even when saddled they will still try and hurt you until you are riding them.
Once you're riding a blaze you can punch to force the blaze to shoot some fireballs to wherever they are facing currently.

By default the blazes will set you on fire while you ride them but that can be disabled in the config by setting `burnWhileRiding` to false.
